## Why Another Teleprompter?

Most teleprompter applications available today come with limitations:
- They're either paid or require subscriptions
- They're cloud-based, raising privacy concerns
- They lack essential features for comfortable reading
- They require internet connectivity

PromptPal was born over a weekend to address these limitations. As a content creator making YouTube videos, I needed a simple yet effective teleprompter that would work offline and help me maintain eye contact with the camera while reading scripts naturally.

What makes PromptPal special is its unique spotlight feature - a focused reading area that helps you concentrate on the current text while maintaining context of what's coming next.
